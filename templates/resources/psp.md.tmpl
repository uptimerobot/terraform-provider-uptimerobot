## Example Usage

### Basic Public Status Page

{{tffile "examples/resources/uptimerobot_psp/basic.tf"}}

### Status Page with Custom Domain

{{tffile "examples/resources/uptimerobot_psp/custom_domain.tf"}}

### Password Protected Status Page

{{tffile "examples/resources/uptimerobot_psp/password_protected.tf"}}

### Status Page with Custom Styling

{{tffile "examples/resources/uptimerobot_psp/custom_styling.tf"}}

`logo` and `icon` accept only local filesystem paths.
If you need to fetch files from a URL, download them first (for example in CI) and point Terraform to the downloaded file paths.
Set either field to an empty string (`""`) to clear the existing uploaded file.

## Status Page Features

- **Custom Domain**: Use your own domain for the status page
- **Password Protection**: Restrict access with a password
- **Custom Styling**: Apply custom CSS and branding
- **Google Analytics**: Track status page visitors
- **SEO Control**: Control search engine indexing

## Monitor Selection

You can include specific monitors in your status page by providing their IDs in the `monitor_ids` list. This allows you to:
- Show only public-facing services
- Create different status pages for different audiences
- Group related services together
